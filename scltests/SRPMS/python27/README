Package %{scl_name} provides Python 2.7 interpreter with a set of extension
packages delivered as a Software Collection. For more information about
Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name}
collection, you will get Python 2.7 interpreter and several extension packages
useful for web applications development.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'python'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac and MFC).

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'python'
  Run python from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man python'
  Show man pages for the python command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
